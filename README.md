## Key Aspects

Baseline Testing: This initial assessment will help gauge the student's current knowledge and skills. It can be conducted as a diagnostic test with a variety of questions covering all major topics of the course. The complexity and difficulty of the problems should span the full range of expected skill levels.

Subject Matter Knowledge: This involves examining the student's understanding of concepts in specific subject areas. The questions in this section should be designed to test both breadth (across a range of topics) and depth (more advanced concepts within those topics).

Problem-Solving Skills: This is to measure the student's ability to apply their knowledge to solve problems. This could be assessed with questions that require the student to apply learned concepts in novel contexts or to find solutions to complex problems. This will test their ability to think logically, critically, and creatively.

Analytical Skills: Test the student's ability to analyze data, make predictions, and draw conclusions. This could involve presenting them with a dataset or a real-world situation and asking them to interpret it and make inferences.

Communication Skills: In science and mathematics, being able to effectively communicate one's understanding is critical. This could involve asking students to explain a concept in their own words, or to justify their solution to a problem.

Attitudinal Survey: A student's attitude towards learning and their beliefs about their own abilities can greatly influence their performance. A survey can help understand a student's mindset and attitude towards learning, which is useful for identifying any emotional or motivational barriers to their success.

Progress Over Time: Regularly scheduled assessments throughout the course can provide insight into how a student's skills and understanding are improving over time. This longitudinal data can be used to adjust teaching strategies and interventions as needed.
